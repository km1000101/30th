## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with camera access
- Internet connection for AI model loading
- Camera device (webcam or mobile camera)
- Microphone access for voice recognition (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Wait for the AI model to load
5. Start using sign language gestures!

### Using Voice Recognition
1. **Click the microphone button** in the "Voice to Sign Language" section
2. **Speak clearly** when the button shows "Listening..."
3. **View the matching GIF** that appears based on your speech
4. **Try different phrases** - the system understands various ways to say each sign

### Usage
1. **Allow Camera Access**: Grant permission when prompted
2. **Position Your Hands**: Place your hands clearly in the camera view
3. **Perform Signs**: Use the tutorial panel to learn supported gestures
4. **View Results**: See real-time text translation of your signs

## üìö Supported Signs

The system currently recognizes:
- **Hello** - Wave your hand in greeting
- **Thank You** - Touch your chin and move forward
- **I Love You** - Extend thumb, index, and pinky

### Voice Recognition Keywords
The speech recognition system understands various ways to say each sign:
- **Hello**: "hello", "hi", "hey", "greetings", "good morning", "good afternoon", "good evening"
- **Thank You**: "thank you", "thanks", "thank", "grateful", "appreciate", "bless you"
- **I Love You**: "i love you", "love you", "love", "heart", "care", "affection"
- **How Are You** - Point to yourself then others
